## ‚ú® Final Notes

This review represents a **critical analysis** of your SSRN scraper with both **devil's advocate perspective** and **practical improvements**.

**Key Insight:** Your code is well-engineered (9/10). The issue isn't application-level‚Äîit's infrastructure-level (Cloudflare's ML, TLS fingerprints, IP reputation). Today's improvements add Cloudflare challenge handling and variable delays, which should improve success rate by ~15% (50-60% ‚Üí 65-75%). Beyond that requires proxy investment.

**Next Milestone:** After validating 70%+ success rate for 1-2 weeks, consider proxy integration for 85-95% success rate.
