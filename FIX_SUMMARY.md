# SSRN Scraper Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong

Your SSRN scraper was returning empty error messages after 5-10 successful entries.

**Root cause:** The `search_ssrn()` method caught exceptions but only returned `True`/`False` without propagating the error message.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Error Propagation
- Changed `search_ssrn()` to return `(success: bool, error_message: str)`
- Now you'll see the ACTUAL exception details

### 2. Exponential Backoff Retry
- Automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times
- Increases delay exponentially: 5s, 10s, 20s

### 3. Specific Exception Handling
- `TimeoutException`: Page elements not loading
- `WebDriverException`: Chrome/Selenium issues
- Generic `Exception`: Unexpected errors with type name

## Files Updated

1. `src/cite_hustle/collectors/ssrn_scraper.py` - Fixed + retry logic
2. `README.md` - Updated features
3. `warp.md` - Marked SSRN scraper complete
4. `DEBUGGING_SSRN.md` - Full debugging guide

## Next Steps

### Test the fix:
```bash
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --limit 10 --delay 8
```

### Check actual errors:
```python
from cite_hustle.database.models import DatabaseManager
from cite_hustle.config import settings

db = DatabaseManager(settings.db_path)
db.connect()

failed = db.con.execute("""
    SELECT doi, error_message 
    FROM processing_log
    WHERE stage = 'scrape_ssrn' AND status = 'failed'
    ORDER BY processed_at DESC LIMIT 10
""").fetchdf()
print(failed)
```

### Debug visually:
```bash
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --no-headless --limit 5
```

## Why It's Likely Rate Limiting

Each paper = 4+ HTTP requests:
1. Homepage
2. Search
3. Click result
4. Load paper

After 10 papers = 40+ requests â†’ SSRN blocks you

## Better Approaches

1. **Increase delay:** `--delay 10` or higher
2. **Direct URLs:** If you have SSRN IDs, skip search entirely
3. **Batch processing:** 10 papers at a time, wait hours between batches

## What You'll See Now

Instead of empty messages, specific errors:
```
Timeout waiting for page elements: Unable to locate element...
WebDriver error: chrome not reachable
```

Share these actual errors and we can optimize further!

See `DEBUGGING_SSRN.md` for complete debugging guide.
