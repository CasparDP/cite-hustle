## PDF Downloader - READY TO USE! ‚úÖ

### What Was the Problem?

Your SSRN scraper collected **1,982 papers** with:
- ‚úÖ SSRN paper URLs
- ‚úÖ Abstracts  
- ‚úÖ HTML content
- ‚ùå **NO PDF download URLs**

The PDF downloader needed direct PDF URLs to work, but they weren't being extracted.

### The Solution

Instead of scraping PDF URLs, the downloader now **constructs them automatically**:

```
SSRN Paper: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5010688
            ‚Üì (extract abstract ID: 5010688)
PDF URL:    https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5010688.pdf?abstractid=5010688&mirid=1
```

### What Changed

**Modified Files:**
1. `src/cite_hustle/collectors/pdf_downloader.py` - Added URL construction logic
2. `src/cite_hustle/database/repository.py` - Query now looks for `ssrn_url` instead of `pdf_url`
3. `src/cite_hustle/cli/commands.py` - Passes SSRN URLs to downloader

**No Changes Needed:**
- ‚úÖ SSRN scraper - works as-is
- ‚úÖ Database schema - no changes
- ‚úÖ Existing data - all 1,982 papers usable!
