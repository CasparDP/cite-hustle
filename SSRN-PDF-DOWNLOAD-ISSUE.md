# SSRN PDF Download Issue - October 2025

## Problem

As of October 2025, SSRN has implemented **Cloudflare bot protection** that prevents automated PDF downloads. This affects the `cite-hustle download` command.

### What's Happening

1. **Old behavior**: Direct HTTP requests to PDF URLs would return PDF files
2. **New behavior**: PDF URLs redirect to Cloudflare challenge pages requiring JavaScript

### Error Messages You'll See

```
✗ SSRN Cloudflare protection detected: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5010688.pdf?abstractid=5010688&mirid=1
  → SSRN now blocks automated downloads. Manual download required.

⚠️  1 PDFs blocked by SSRN's anti-bot protection
   SSRN now uses Cloudflare to prevent automated PDF downloads.
   Consider using a browser automation tool like Selenium for PDF downloads.
```

## Impact

- **SSRN scraping**: ✅ Still works (already uses Selenium)
- **Metadata collection**: ✅ Still works (uses CrossRef API)
- **PDF downloads**: ❌ Blocked by Cloudflare

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Browser Automation (Recommended)

Update the PDF downloader to use Selenium (like the SSRN scraper):

```python
# Future implementation using Selenium WebDriver
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

def download_pdf_with_selenium(ssrn_url: str, output_dir: Path):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Needs ChromeDriver
    driver.get(ssrn_url)
    
    # Find and click download button
    download_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//a[contains(@href, 'Delivery.cfm')]")
    download_button.click()
    
    # Handle download
    # ... implementation details
```

**Pros:**
- Handles JavaScript challenges automatically
- Can interact with download buttons
- More robust against anti-bot measures

**Cons:**
- Slower (browser overhead)
- More complex setup (requires ChromeDriver)
- Higher resource usage

### Option 2: Manual Download Workflow

Create a helper that generates download URLs for manual downloading:

```bash
# Export URLs for manual download
poetry run cite-hustle export-pdf-urls --output urls.txt

# User manually downloads PDFs using browser
# Then import downloaded files
poetry run cite-hustle import-pdfs --dir ~/Downloads
```

### Option 3: Wait for SSRN Policy Changes

Monitor SSRN for changes to their anti-bot policies.

## Current Status

The PDF downloader has been updated to:
- ✓ Detect Cloudflare protection
- ✓ Provide clear error messages
- ✓ Suggest alternative approaches
- ✓ Continue processing other papers gracefully
- ✓ **NEW: Selenium-based downloading implemented!**

### Selenium Implementation (COMPLETED)

As of October 2025, we've successfully implemented Selenium-based PDF downloads:

- ✓ `SeleniumPDFDownloader` class created
- ✓ Browser automation handles Cloudflare challenges
- ✓ Integrated into CLI with `--use-selenium` flag
- ✓ Successfully tested and confirmed working
- ✓ Proper error handling for unavailable PDFs

## Workarounds

1. **Manual download**: Use browser to manually download important PDFs
2. **Focus on metadata**: Use `cite-hustle collect` and `cite-hustle scrape` to build database
3. **Selective downloads**: Prioritize most important papers for manual download

## Future Development

The recommended next step is implementing **Option 1** (Selenium-based downloads) similar to how the SSRN scraper works. This would require:

1. Extending `src/cite_hustle/collectors/pdf_downloader.py` to use Selenium
2. Finding download buttons/links on SSRN paper pages
3. Handling browser download mechanics
4. Managing Chrome/Firefox WebDriver dependencies

## Usage

### Selenium-based Downloads (Recommended)

```bash
# Download PDFs using browser automation (bypasses Cloudflare)
poetry run cite-hustle download --limit 10 --use-selenium

# Show browser window for debugging
poetry run cite-hustle download --limit 5 --use-selenium --no-headless

# Adjust delay between downloads
poetry run cite-hustle download --limit 20 --use-selenium --delay 3
```

### HTTP Downloads (Legacy - mostly fails)

```bash
# This will show Cloudflare detection in action
poetry run cite-hustle download --limit 1 --delay 1
```
