Migration tracking and notes

STATUS: ✅ = Complete | ⏳ = In Progress | ❌ = Not Started

MIGRATION STATUS:
=================

✅ 1. Metadata Collection (get_meta_articles.py → collectors/metadata.py)
   - Migrated CrossRef API logic
   - Integrated with JournalRegistry
   - Saves to database via ArticleRepository
   - Connected to CLI 'collect' command
   - Maintains caching mechanism
   - Retry logic and rate limiting preserved
   - Both sequential and parallel modes available
   - Automatic FTS index rebuilding after collection

✅ 2. SSRN Scraping (get_pdf_links.py → collectors/ssrn_scraper.py)
   - Extracted Selenium setup and WebDriver configuration
   - Migrated search and scraping logic
   - Migrated fuzzy title matching (rapidfuzz)
   - HTML storage to html_storage_dir
   - Integrated with ArticleRepository
   - Connected to CLI 'scrape' command
   - Added progress tracking with tqdm
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Cookie acceptance handling
   - Configurable crawl delay and similarity threshold
   - Graceful interrupt handling (Ctrl+C)
   - Automatic skipping of already-scraped articles

✅ 3. PDF Download (collectors/pdf_downloader.py)
   - Already implemented
   - Connected to CLI 'download' command
   - Working with progress tracking
   - Note: Needs PDF URL extraction from SSRN HTML pages

TESTING:
========

Test Metadata Collector:
-------------------------
poetry run cite-hustle collect --field accounting --year-start 2023 --year-end 2023
poetry run cite-hustle status
poetry run cite-hustle search "earnings"

Test SSRN Scraper:
------------------
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --limit 10
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --no-headless --limit 5  # Show browser
poetry run cite-hustle status

Test Full Workflow:
-------------------
poetry run cite-hustle collect --field accounting --year-start 2023 --year-end 2023
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --limit 50
poetry run cite-hustle status
poetry run cite-hustle search "earnings management"

COMPARISON: OLD vs NEW
======================

Metadata Collection:
OLD:
- Hardcoded journal dict
- Saves to CSV files
- Manual cache management
- Difficult to track progress
- Not integrated with database

NEW:
- Uses JournalRegistry (single source of truth)
- Saves directly to DuckDB database
- Automatic cache management
- Progress bars and status updates
- Full integration with repository pattern
- Logging for debugging
- Sequential and parallel modes
- Skips already collected data
- Automatic FTS index rebuilding

SSRN Scraping:
OLD:
- Standalone script
- Direct DuckDB queries
- Manual connection management
- Limited error handling
- No HTML file storage
- Print statements only
- No progress tracking

NEW:
- Class-based SSRNScraper
- Repository pattern for database
- Automatic connection management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Saves HTML to Dropbox directory
- Progress bars (tqdm)
- Database logging (processing_log)
- CLI integration with options
- Better Selenium setup
- Cookie handling
- Graceful interrupts

WORKFLOW EXAMPLES:
==================

Example 1: Collect recent accounting papers
-------------------------------------------
poetry run cite-hustle collect --field accounting --year-start 2023
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --limit 100
poetry run cite-hustle status

Example 2: Scrape with custom settings
--------------------------------------
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --delay 3 --threshold 90 --limit 50

Example 3: Show browser for debugging
-------------------------------------
poetry run cite-hustle scrape --no-headless --limit 5

Example 4: Search collected papers
----------------------------------
poetry run cite-hustle search "disclosure"
poetry run cite-hustle search "Ball" --author

Example 5: Complete pipeline
----------------------------
# Collect metadata
poetry run cite-hustle collect --field all --year-start 2023 --year-end 2024

# Scrape SSRN
poetry run cite-hustle scrape

# Check progress
poetry run cite-hustle status

# Search
poetry run cite-hustle search "earnings management"

# Download PDFs (when PDF URLs available)
poetry run cite-hustle download

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. ✅ Test metadata collector - DONE
2. ✅ Test SSRN scraper - DONE
3. ⏳ Extract PDF URLs from SSRN HTML pages - TODO
4. ⏳ Integrate PDF downloader with extracted URLs - TODO
5. ⏳ Build web GUI (FastAPI + React/Streamlit) - FUTURE
6. ⏳ Deploy to cloud - FUTURE

PDF URL Extraction TODO:
------------------------
The SSRN scraper currently saves HTML pages but doesn't extract PDF URLs yet.
Need to:
1. Parse SSRN HTML to find PDF download links
2. Update ssrn_pages table with pdf_url
3. Then pdf_downloader can use those URLs

Example code to add to ssrn_scraper.py:
```python
def extract_pdf_url(html_content: str) -> Optional[str]:
    '''Extract PDF URL from SSRN HTML'''
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'lxml')
    
    # Find PDF download link
    pdf_link = soup.select_one('a[href*=".pdf"]')
    if pdf_link:
        return pdf_link['href']
    
    return None
```

MIGRATION COMPLETE: ✅✅✅
========================

Both metadata collection and SSRN scraping have been successfully migrated!

The new system is:
- ✅ Modular and maintainable
- ✅ Testable and debuggable
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ User-friendly with CLI
- ✅ Integrated with database
- ✅ Configurable via settings
- ✅ Production-ready

Old scripts (get_meta_articles.py, get_pdf_links.py) can now be:
- Kept for reference
- Archived to /scripts/legacy/ directory
- Or deleted if confident in new system

Workflow is ready to use! 🚀
